### This is a brand new FastAPI CRUD application that uses a PostgreSQL database for me to practice FastAPI.

- Being a "minimal" web-framework, FastAPI doesn't have built-in authentication, a database ORM, templating, or HTML form handling like Django.
- However, it has different features that make it very pleasant to work with and you can bolt on all those other features that Django has if you really need them.


- routers(goes to the database): add more endpoints
- queries(FastAPI endpoints): write sql to interact with databases
(We separate folders instead of putting all endpoints inside main.py just for good code organization)
